OK, I think it may not be the best idea to create a overly-structured
Distribution hirearchy.  Its probably best simply to provide an
interface "Distribution" which specifies methods that give information
about the distribution but nothing more.  Individual distributions can
be given interfaces, for instance the normal distribution, but I
suspect thats as far as we want to go.
