----------
ExpressionTarget and ExpressionGeneralProposal both assume that
all statements are of the form 

    name ~ Fn(arg1, arg2, ..)  

However, we want to allow arbitrary code.  To permit this, we should
parse through the statements checking if a function is called on the
RHS of a ~ expression.  If so, then the function name needs to be
translated from 

     Fn(arg1, arg2, ...)

to

     Fn.logPDF(arg1, arg2, ... )

if not, the subexpression should be left unchanged.

The goal is to permit statments like:

    X ~ N(mu[[1]],sigma[[1]]) + rho * N(mu[[2]],sigma[[2]])

to be properly translated into

    N.logPDF(X,mu[[1]],sigma[[1]]) + rho *  N.logPDF(X,mu[[2]],sigma[[2]])
