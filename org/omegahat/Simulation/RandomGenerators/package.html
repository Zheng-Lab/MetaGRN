Java implemenation of Bruce J. Colling's Parallel Random Number generator 
                       (see Collings, 1987 JASA)

 * For each individual random stream, random numbers are produced by
 * using one generator to randomly select one of NUMGEN generators to
 * produce the requested random number.  Each generator is multiplicative
 * congruential with the multiplicative constants selected randomly with
 * replacement from a pool of 112 "good" constants.  This (virtually)
 * assures that the random stream for each processor is independent.
 * Each stream should have a period of length 4.6E18.

 * Revision 1.2  1999/07/07 13:49:40  warnes
 *  - Modified PRNGAdministrator class to return PRNGStates rather than
 *    returning an instance of the PRNG.
 *  - Created a Factory, PRNGFactory, that uses reflectance to instantiate
 *    the correct class using the PRNGState.
 *  - Modified PRNGState to include a method that returns the fully-qualified
 *    class name to make instantiation possible.
 *  - Changed (almost) all "private" declarations to "package".

 * intializing all generators exactly the same!
